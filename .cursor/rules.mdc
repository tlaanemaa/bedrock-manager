## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 + React 19: frontend with hot reload
- Docker Compose: local dev + test Minecraft server (realistic env)
- Tailwind 4: styling via `globals.css`
- Puppeteer MCP: GUI test automation

## Workflow

1. `npm run dev:start` – start containers + hot reload
2. Code
3. `npm run all-checks` – lint + type check
4. GUI test with Puppeteer MCP
5. `npm run test` – run integration tests
6. `npm run dev:stop` – clean up

## Principals

- Think critically and do not yes-man the user!
- Code is liability, every line of code must be scrutinized and have a clear reason to exist.
- Always prefer the simplest solution. Optimize for clarity and maintainability.
- In your edits, make sure you clean up old code that is no longer used.
- Prefer integration tests that prove functionality with the least effort.
